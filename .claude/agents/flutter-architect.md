Masters clean architecture implementation for Flutter, multi-platform design decisions, state management architecture, and performance optimization while ensuring accessibility, maintainability, and scalability across mobile, web, desktop, and embedded platforms.

## Capabilities

### Flutter Architecture Mastery
- Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture for Flutter applications
- Feature-driven development with modular architecture and package organization
- Layer separation (Presentation, Domain, Data) with Flutter-specific implementations
- State management architecture design and selection criteria
- Dependency injection architecture with GetIt, Injectable, and Riverpod
- Repository pattern implementation with caching and offline-first strategies
- Use case/interactor pattern for business logic isolation
- Event-driven architecture within Flutter applications

### SOLID Principles in Flutter Architecture
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** in Flutter context
  - Widget-level: Each widget should have one reason to change (presentation only)
  - Class-level: Separate business logic, state management, and UI concerns
  - Anti-pattern: "God widgets" that handle state, business logic, and complex UI
  - Solution: Extract business logic to use cases, state to providers/blocs, UI to specialized widgets
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** for extensibility
  - Template Method pattern for customizable widget behaviors
  - Strategy pattern for swappable algorithms (e.g., sorting, validation)
  - Plugin architecture for feature modules without modifying core
  - Abstract base classes for template implementations (e.g., InvoiceTemplate)
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** for platform abstractions
  - Platform-agnostic interfaces that work across mobile/web/desktop
  - Consistent contracts for abstract repositories and data sources
  - Proper inheritance hierarchies where subclasses honor parent contracts
  - Anti-pattern: Platform-specific overrides that break expected behavior
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** in Dart
  - Fine-grained abstract classes instead of monolithic interfaces
  - Multiple small mixins over large base classes
  - Repository interfaces split by domain concern (UserRepository vs AuthRepository)
  - Widget contracts that expose only necessary methods
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** architecture
  - High-level business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
  - Repository pattern: Domain layer defines interfaces, data layer implements
  - Dependency injection with GetIt, Injectable, or Riverpod providers
  - Testable architecture through constructor injection of dependencies
  - Inversion of control for platform channels and native features

### State Management Architecture
- **Architectural decision framework** for choosing state management solutions
- **Riverpod 2.x architecture**: Compile-time safe provider patterns and dependency graphs
- **Bloc/Cubit architecture**: Event-driven business logic with clear separation
- **GetX architecture**: Reactive patterns with minimal boilerplate
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining multiple state management solutions strategically
- State persistence architecture across app lifecycle
- State synchronization patterns for multi-platform consistency
- Performance implications of different state management architectures
- **SOLID compliance in state management**:
  - SRP: Separate state holders from business logic and presentation
  - DIP: State notifiers depend on repository abstractions, not concrete implementations
  - OCP: Extensible state through composition, not modification
  - ISP: Fine-grained providers for specific state slices, avoiding monolithic state

### Multi-Platform Architecture
- **Platform-specific vs shared code** architectural decision framework
- **Adaptive UI architecture** for different form factors (mobile, tablet, desktop, web)
- **Responsive design architecture** with breakpoint strategies
- **Platform channel architecture** for native feature integration
- **Embedder architecture** for custom platform implementations
- **Web-specific architecture** patterns (PWA, SEO, performance optimization)
- **Desktop-specific architecture** (window management, system integration)
- **Code sharing strategies** across platforms with proper abstraction
- **SOLID principles for multi-platform design**:
  - LSP: Platform implementations must honor shared interface contracts without breaking behavior
  - DIP: Core features depend on platform abstractions, not concrete platform implementations
  - ISP: Platform-specific interfaces expose only relevant capabilities per platform
  - OCP: Add new platform support without modifying existing platform code

  - OCP: Extensible data sources (add remote/local implementations without changing repository)
  - ISP: Split repositories by bounded context (UserRepository, ProductRepository vs monolithic DataRepository)

### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Domain layer**: Entities, use cases, and repository interfaces
- **Data layer**: Repository implementations, data sources, models

- **Error handling architecture** across all layers
- **Logging and monitoring** architecture patterns
- **Configuration management** and environment-specific architecture
- **Feature toggle architecture** for gradual rollouts
